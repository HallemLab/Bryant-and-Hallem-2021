# Description of Supplemental Files 

File S1 contains codon usage frequencies and optimal codons for:

- highly abundant *S. ratti* expressed sequence tag (EST) transcripts (Mitreva *et al* 2006)
- highly expressed *C. elegans* genes (Sharp and Bradnam 1997)
- highly expressed *P. pacificus* genes (Han *et al* 2020)
- *B. malayi* genes (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/)
- *N. brasiliensis* contigs (http://www.nematode.net)
- all *S. ratti* ESTs (Mitreva *et al* 2006).  

File S2 contains a code freeze for the Wild Worm Codon Adapter.  

File S3 contains gene IDs, codon adaptation index (CAI) values, and GC ratios of the 2% of genes with the highest and lowest CAI values for each *Strongyloides* species and *C. elegans*.  

File S4 contains GO analysis results for the 2% of genes with the highest and lowest CAI values for each *Strongyloides* species and *C. elegans*.  

File S5 contains GO terms significantly enriched in all four *Strongyloides* species for the following functional subsets:

- highest (top 2%) *Strongyloides* codon-adapted sequences
- lowest (bottom 2%) *Strongyloides*-codon-adapted sequences
- highest (top 2%) AT-rich sequences
- highest (top 2%) GC-rich sequences.
